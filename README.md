Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words.
  - A Blockchain is a Shared Database. It should be decentralized in a manner that the database is spread across multiple locations. This prevents a single point of failure and is one of the main reasons a blockchain is so secure. It should be public in the sense that anyone, anywhere can view the data in the database at any time. This transparency reduces the likelihood of hiding things in the database. It should also be Open in the sense that anyone can interact with the blockchain and create content.
