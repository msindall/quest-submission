### Chapter 1
#### Day 1

Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words.
  - A Blockchain is a Shared Database. It should be decentralized in a manner that the database is spread across multiple locations. This prevents a single point of failure and is one of the main reasons a blockchain is so secure. It should be public in the sense that anyone, anywhere can view the data in the database at any time. This transparency reduces the likelihood of hiding things in the database. It should also be Open in the sense that anyone can interact with the blockchain and create content.

Explain what a Smart Contract is. You can read this to help you, but you don't have to: https://www.ibm.com/topics/smart-contracts
 - A smart contract is a way of defining a ruleset to store or use information in a desired manner. It is an agreement between the creator and signer to perform certain actions. Due to a blockchain being open and usable for anything, a smart contract is a way of telling it what to do or information to store, how to do it, and with who. They are automatically fulfilled when requirements are met without the need for a middleman to ease and speed up the process of completion.

Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.
- A script is a way of viewing data on the blockchain and can br un by anyone at any time and does not cost money. This allows us to read information.
- A transaction will modify data in the blockchain, and thus will cost money and need to be verified by other users on the blockchain


#### Day 2
What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?
- Safety and Security
- Clarity
- Approachability
- Developer Experience
- Resource Oriented Programming


In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?
1. Safety and Security is the key to onboarding the masses. No one wants to invest to lose money. Losing money can come in the form of a hack, poorly designed code or interfaces, or general misunderstanding of what the user is doing. Focusing on the user's safety and security first means more users will want to use it.
2. Clarity in anything is important. The better instructions we have, the better we can execute. If we can communicate clearly, everything goes exponentially quicker. Best illustrated by the kid's game Telephone tag, if one person isn't clear on the instructions, it quickly goes wrong.
3. Approachability is important to attract developers to build the ecosystem. If I can write this code without having coded for years, it should be easier for me to also get good at it, and the quicker we all master the code the quicker it grows in utility.
4. If the developer experience is poor, or the onboarding is too extensive, I wouldn't even try to learn it. Having easy to use tools is important, especially in attracting new developers to the ecosystem and then keeping them.
5. File sizes, lost data, and careless programming could all be reduced by having to actually use the resources you create. Much like wasting food or fuel, the more we limit it the better hte habits we have.
